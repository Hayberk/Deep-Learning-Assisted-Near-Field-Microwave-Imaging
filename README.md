# Graduation Project
Worked on the integration of deep learning with near-field microwave imaging for graduation project. The project focused on certain needs and technological specifications crucial for near-field microwave imaging improvement to address its limits. The issue is that because the wavelength of microwave imaging is quite large compared to the item being studied, it has limited resolution in the near-field region. A neural network was trained with deep learning-assisted microwave imaging to improve the resolution of the images produced by NFMI.
